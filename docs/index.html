            <h4>Motivational speech</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="ParagraphStyle"> I always take everything very seriously and approach things with utmost restraint. During my life I have never kicked a hedgehog despite various circumstances presenting me with such an opportunituy. Let it be known that I know someone who
                makes excellent potassium and everyone else makes inferior potassium. Let the records show that I have never been guilty of arson (as stated by court.) I have never once voted for a party that has promissed anything as I do not like to
                get my hopes up. I always vote for the people who look strange, because then it is funnier to insult them when they fail me. </p>
            <br>
            <p> My faults to which there are many. I have fainted several times and I'm afraid that it has developed into a hoby. I sometimes use just one of my eyes so that I could be lazy with the other. I never pick up the phone when anyone calls me, because
                I already know I won't be able to help them. I have been instructed by a court order that I have to observe a 400 meter distance from the court. I am the guy who convinced everyone at work to sing "Happy Birthday" to you and I'll do it
                again next year. No regrets. I am alergic to crosses and other religious symbols, as I always get blisters when I hold them. I know only one phrase in Roma language and I'd be expelled if I told it to you. I do not consider baseball a
                good sport and am ready to fight about it.</p>
